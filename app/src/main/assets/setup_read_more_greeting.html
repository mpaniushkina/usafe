<p>
    Although Covr will still work with notifications turned OFF, you will not be
    aware of incoming requests (unless the app is open on your screen). Covr
    requests are time-sensitive and If you do not respond within the given time
    frame, they will be automatically denied.</p>
<p>So remember: If you turn OFF notifications while traveling, for example, you
    must open the Covr app in order to accept/deny/reject requests before they
    expire.</p>
