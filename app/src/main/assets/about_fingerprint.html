    <div class="covr-title">Does Fingerprint Pose a Security Risk?</div>
    <div class="covr-text">As with all new technologies, some people have security concerns about fingerprint and wonder whether there are ways to reduce the threat of supposed shortcomings. Unlike passwords, fingerprints cannot be reset. The main risks centered around fingerprint are based on the fact that analysts say it is possible to replicate a person’s fingerprint by using a variety of methods.</div>
    <div class="covr-text">If a device is shared, any user can add a fingerprint to fingerprint. If unauthorised access is obtained to the device (by guessing or otherwise obtaining the passcode as opposed to an opportunist accessing an already unlocked iPhone or iPad) then the unauthorised user can also add their fingerprint for later use.</div>
    <div class="covr-text">Any application that integrates with the fingerprint API will simply receive a response that a trusted fingerprint has been used – there is no information as to which fingerprint it was and whom it belonged to. Access to an application would be granted to anyone that has saved a fingerprint over the life of the device.</div>
    <div class="covr-text">In the home, the worst case scenario may be that your partner or children can use the fingerprint they’ve stored to quickly and easily access your banking application - or any other application that accepts fingerprint as a replacement for much less convenient passwords. While this may be acceptable to some, it’s potentially a dangerous approach for any device that’s used by multiple individuals in an enterprise environment.</div>
    <div class="covr-text">However, there are ways to minimize the associated security risks, and especially those related to fingerprint transfers. During controlled experiments, hackers were able to trick the fingerprint technology by taking a photograph of a fingerprint that had transferred to a glass surface. However, in those cases, the index finger’s print was always used.</div>
    <div class="covr-text">It is smart to get into the habit of only unlocking your device with a pinky or ring finger. It is less likely fingerprints from those fingers could be swiftly swiped from common glass items like beverage containers and tabletops.</div>
    <div class="covr-text">All in all, hacking fingerprint is not an easy task. It requires the skills, academic research and the patience of a Crime Scene Technician. Yet this does not mean that the system is not prone to being hacked.</div>
