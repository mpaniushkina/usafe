    <div class="covr-text">A secure connection can be added with any Covr partner. Covr partners include bank websites, e-mail and cloud servers, social media sites, e-commerce sites or other products that have selected Covr as a partner for ultimate security and for your peace of mind.</div>
    <div class="covr-text">You will initiate the secure connection process from a Covr partner’s site. Then you will receive an SMS with a verification code in your messaging inbox. This is a part of the process that will establish a secure connection between you and the partner through Covr’s servers.</div>
    <div class="covr-text">If you do not see the SMS with the verification code appear as an Alert/Pop-up or as a Banner, you must open your SMS messaging inbox, memorize the verification code and then return to Covr and enter it into the app.</div>
    <div class="covr-text">If no SMS is received you should go to the website or product where you initiated the secure connection process and follow the instructions there.</div>
    <div class="covr-text">After you receive the SMS you need to enter the 4-digit verification code to complete the secure connection.</div>
    <div class="covr-text">All your secure connections are listed in the Connections list, which you will find in the Menu.</div>
